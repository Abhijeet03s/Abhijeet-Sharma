          Hey, I&apos;m Abhijeet. I&apos;m a Frontend Engineer fascinated by bringing ideas to life on screen.
          I&apos;ve spent countless hours chasing the perfect shade of blue ðŸŽ¨, only to tweak it the next day.
          For me, it&apos;s all about experimenting, iterating, and creating interfaces that make you go, &apos;Whoa!&apos;
          And when I&apos;m not tweaking pixels, you&apos;ll probably find me chasing headshots in an FPS game. ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ®
